# Our Revolution Cambridge: Setting the Agenda

In the spirit of democracy and inclusiveness and to keep the meetings focused on what members find important, we’ve proposed the following process for setting the agenda for our normal, weekly meetings. It has two parts:

1. Propose items for the agenda
2. Vote to accept proposed items for the agenda

## Proposing an Agenda Item
Early in the week before a meeting, we will send out a form to propose an agenda item. Anyone may submit an item for the upcoming meeting. **Submissions will close a few days before the next weekly meeting.** (So that we have enough time as a group to vote on the agenda.)

When you submit your item be sure to include:

1. A brief, one sentence description of your proposal.
2. A short explanation why your proposal is relevant for Our Revolution Cambridge.
3. What actions, if any, the group would need to take based on your proposal

These three things don’t need to be long---just enough information for your fellow ORC members to understand what it is you’d like the group to do.

### General Announcements Do Not Need to Be Proposed
Weekly meetings will include a short, set amount of time for general announcements. 

If you have an announcement, e.g., for an upcoming rally that you want everyone to be aware of but doesn’t need organizational support from ORC, this is the time to say it. No voting required. All voices heard.

## Voting on the Agenda
Now that we have lots of items proposed for next week’s meeting, it’s time to vote. Once submission period closes, everyone in the group has a few days to vote on the agenda.

Any member may vote on one or more individual proposed agenda items.

Every item that receives a majority "yes" vote makes it onto the agenda.

## Accepting the Agenda
Near the start of each normal, weekly meeting, the facilitators will outline the agenda based on that week’s voting. The agenda will include how much time is allotted for each item.

Members who are present at the meeting will vote to accept the meeting agenda. A majority "yes" vote accepts the agenda.

## Addenda to the Agenda
Of course new and important things might pop up after submissions have closed for the week. To accommodate the messy and spontaneous nature of reality, any member may make motions to an add items to the agenda at the beginning of the meeting, before the agenda has been accepted.
 
Members may also make motions to alter the time allotted to individual items.

Motions must be seconded by another member, followed by a general vote. Motions pass on with majority "yes" vote.
